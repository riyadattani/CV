I am an intellectually-curious software developer geared to launch my career in the technology space.

From analysing economic models during my economics degree to dealing with tax fraud in accordance with UK law, my diverse background has shaped my passion for deciphering practical problems, creatively building useful solutions while continuously learning and growing with like-minded individuals.

I gravitated to the tech industry because I believe technology can effectively be used to positively impact economic, social and environmental change. I am driven to be a part of this by utilizing my programming processes paired with my problem solving skills to develop high-quality code for meaningful ideas or dilemmas.

I recently graduated from an intensive software bootcamp called [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) where I have built a strong foundation of programming concepts and processes. I am looking to kickstart my tech career in a growth mindset atmosphere where I can be challenged.
