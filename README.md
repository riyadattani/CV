I am an enthusiastic, confident and eclectic software developer geared to launch my career in the technology space.

From analysing economic models during my economics degree to dealing with tax fraud in accordance with UK law, my diverse background has shaped my passion of deciphering practical problems, creatively building useful solutions while continuously learning and growing with like-minded individuals.

I gravitated to the tech industry because I am an advocate of effectively and ethically using technology to positively impact economic, social and environmental change. I am driven to be a part of this by utilizing my programming processes paired with my problem-solving skills to develop high-quality code for meaningful ideas or dilemmas.

I recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), an intensive software bootcamp, where I up-skilled and established a strong foundation of programming concepts, processes and agile practices. I am looking to kickstart my tech career in a growth mindset atmosphere where I can be challenged.

## Skills

#### Excellent communicator

During my time at BDO LLP, I had a client-facing role where I obtained and recorded relevant information from the client to wholly understand their tax position. Due to the sensitive nature of these cases, not only did I learn to converse in an objective way but I also learned to respond effectively based on body language and personality type. Additionally, as a part-time club leader to primary school children, I constantly practice explaining tasks in a clear and simple way by breaking the tasks down and pointing them in the right direction or challenging them to extend their ability to creatively solve problems.

As a result, my growing emotional intelligence enables me to articulate well during scenarios such as pair programming, explaining technical concepts in lament terms and building a good relationship with the people around me.

#### Attention to finer details

From filtering over 120 CV's for 6 managerial positions in a time-frame of 2.5 weeks to sieving through a sea of documents to extract relevant information to calculate the additional tax owed to HMRC by a client, I have honed a sharp eye for finer details.

I have applied this when studying at Makers where I had the opportunity to review my peer's code and either methodically spot the source of the bug in their code or provide feedback to improve their code by understanding the underliying functionallity of their program.

#### Analytical and practical

A large part of job as a junior tax associate was to compute the additional tax a client owed by analysing their unclear historical tax data and minimising the late payment interest and penalties additional to their base tax. To practically achieve this in a fixed time period, as a team we compartmentalized the data relevant to different types of tax and identified the missing holes. We then liaised with the client or third-parties to recover information or made realistic assumptions and created a viable plan. We methodically executed the plan while keeping HMRC in the loop and iteratated on the report documenting our process and the proposed tax payable.

From this experience, weaved with a programming-focused [problem-solving method](https://github.com/riyadattani/makers-portfolio/blob/master/1-i-can-make-anything/6-i-have-a-methodological-approach-to-solve-problems.md) I formed during Makers, I am equipped to tackle challenges with my analytical mind and continously sculpt my problem-solving skills.

#### Team player

Having experienced the importance of team decision making, cohesiveness and adaptability when playing competitive sports such as netball as well as the advantages of agile practices, prioritisation and division of tasks during team projects at Makers, I truly believe in the phrase 'teamwork makes the dream work'.

As a software developer I value knowledge sharing (even if its touching on small points such as this [wiki](https://github.com/riyadattani/weather_station_server/wiki/Code-climate-coverage-configuration-on-.travis.yml-file) I wrote), collaborating effectively to deliver high quality work and helping others grow too.
