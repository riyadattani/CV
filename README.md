I am a confident, unconventional and intellectually-curious software developer geared to launch my career in the technology space.

From analysing economic models during my Economics degree to dealing with tax fraud in accordance with UK law, my diverse background has shaped my passion of deciphering practical problems, creatively building useful solutions while continuously learning and growing with like-minded individuals. I gravitated to the tech industry to follow my 'why' which is effectively and ethically using technology to positively impact economic, social and environmental change.

I recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), an intensive software bootcamp, where I up-skilled and established a strong foundation of programming concepts, processes and agile practices. I am looking to kickstart my tech career in a growth mindset atmosphere where I can be challenged.

## Skills
#### Excellent communicator
During my time at BDO LLP, I had a client-facing role and dealt with sensitive cases on tax fraud. Not only did I learn to communicate in an objective way but I also learned to respond effectively based on body language and personality type. Additionally, as a part-time club leader to primary school children, I practice explaining tasks in a clear way by breaking the tasks down and pointing them in the right direction.

As a result, my growing emotional intelligence enables me to articulate well during scenarios such as pair programming, explaining technical concepts in lament terms and building a good relationship with the people around me.

#### Attention to finer details
From filtering over 120 CVs for 6 managerial positions in a time-frame of 2.5 weeks to sieving through a sea of documents to extract relevant information to calculate tax, I have honed a sharp eye for finer details.

I have applied this when studying at Makers where I had the opportunity to review my peer's code and either [methodically spot the source of the bug](https://github.com/riyadattani/makers-portfolio/blob/master/1-i-can-make-anything/3-i-can-debug-anything.md) in their code or provide feedback to improve their code by understanding the underlying functionality of their program.

#### Analytical and practical
As a junior tax associate I analysed historical tax data for various clients and computed the tax they owe HMRC plus late payment interest and penalties. We practically did this by breaking down the problem, gathering missing information or making reasonable assumptions and documenting our process with the proposed tax payable in a report.

Weaving this experience with a programming-focused [problem-solving method](https://github.com/riyadattani/makers-portfolio/blob/master/1-i-can-make-anything/6-i-have-a-methodological-approach-to-solve-problems.md) I formed during Makers, I am equipped to tackle challenges with my analytical mind and keen to sculpt my problem-solving skills.

#### Team player
Having experienced the importance of team decision making, cohesiveness and adaptability when playing competitive sports such as netball as well as the advantages of [agile practices](https://github.com/riyadattani/makers-portfolio/blob/master/2-i-help-my-teams-succeed/1-i-use-an-agile-product-development-process.md), prioritisation and division of tasks during team projects at Makers, I truly believe in the phrase 'teamwork makes the dream work'.

As a software developer I value knowledge sharing (even if its touching on small points such as this [wiki](https://github.com/riyadattani/weather_station_server/wiki/Code-climate-coverage-configuration-on-.travis.yml-file) I wrote), collaborating effectively to deliver high quality work and helping others grow too.
